          As an adjunct professor, I was given the lattitude to design and teach
          my own curriculum to over eighty students.  I created my own lecture
          notes, slides, tests, and homework assignments.  I consistently sought
          student feedback and incoporated common suggestions into future work.

          My student body included many unique backgrounds including non-traditional
          and ESL students.  I adapted my teaching style to student needs, and
          gave students who were struggling as much attention as they desired.

          I received positive student feedback and was invited to return by the
          faculty, but ultimately decided to pursue a career in software
          development.
